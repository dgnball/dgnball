My recent projects involved leveraging Python and Google Cloud services to deliver solutions for prestigious institutions such as the University of Cambridge 🎓 and the Office for National Statistics 📊. My contributions encompassed requirements gathering, system architecture design, and full-scale implementation. Additionally, I proudly hold the Google Cloud Certified Professional Cloud Developer certification.

Beyond Google Cloud Platform (GCP), I possess professional certifications in AWS, Terraform, and a degree in computer science from Exeter University.
